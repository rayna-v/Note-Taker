# Note Taker

## Motivation
This app allows users to take notes and save them with a title to retrieve later. Notes can be viewed and deleted as needed. It is both practical and user-friendly. I wanted this note-taking application to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to use to encourage users to visit time and again. I will have the 'edit note' feature in future versions of this app. 

## How to Use
To use, simply click the live URL (below) which will take you to the landing page. Once you "Get Started" by clicking the button, you can easily add a title and text to your note and save using the save icon in the top right-hand corner of the page (it appears once you have entered both a title and body text). Viewing notes is easy as well! Simply click the title of the note you would like to view. Notes can be easily be deleted by clicking the red trash can icon. 

## Task
I was given front-end code and given the task to create the backend that would allow users to write and save notes. The application is supposed to use Express.js and retrieve data from a JSON file.
